# Object-Detection-using-DNN

## What is the Purpose of this Project?
The main purpose of this Project is to Detect the Objects using Deep Neural Network and Label (Name) them using the existing Dataset of text files containing the names of all the objects appearing on the screen. I have used the 2 existing Data files and OpenCV library and have included them here too in the Files. Then, I trained them to detect whatever appears on the screen and Label them.

# Object-Detection-using-DNN

## What is the Purpose of this Project?
⋅⋅⋅ The main purpose of this Projject is to Detect the Objects and Label (Name) them using the existing Dataset of text files containing the names of all the   objects appearing on the screen. I have used the 2 existing Data files and have included them here too in the Files. Then, I trained them to detect whatever
appears on the screen and Label them.
